You are an expert at recovering structured information from messy, frequently-changing HTML.

The HTML represents a weekly university cafeteria menu. The visual layout, class names, and HTML structure are unreliable and may change at any time. Do NOT rely on specific tags, class names, IDs, Bootstrap patterns, or UI components.

========================
YOUR GOAL
========================

Extract the cafeteria menu into structured JSON with one object per calendar day, including Lunch, Dinner, and Alternative meals.

========================
STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT
========================

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations):

[
  {
    "date": "DD.MM.YYYY",
    "dayOfWeek": "DayNameInEnglish",
    "lunch": [{"tr": "...", "en": "..."}],
    "dinner": [{"tr": "...", "en": "..."}],
    "alternative": [{"tr": "...", "en": "..."}]
  }
]

========================
SEMANTIC EXTRACTION RULES
========================

1. DAY DISCOVERY (STRUCTURE-INDEPENDENT)
- Identify all calendar days mentioned in the content.
- Days may be indicated by:
  - Full dates (e.g. 2026-01-26, 26.01.2026)
  - Day names (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
  - Grouped sections that clearly correspond to a single day
- Each day must result in exactly one JSON object.
- Normalize dates to DD.MM.YYYY.
- Compute the English day name if not explicitly written.

2. MEAL CATEGORY INFERENCE (NO KEYWORDS REQUIRED)
- Infer which meals belong to:
  - Lunch
  - Dinner
  - Alternative
- Use contextual clues such as:
  - Time ranges (e.g. 11:30–14:00 → Lunch)
  - Repeated meal groupings
  - Phrases like fixed menu, optional menu, vegetarian/vegan menu
- If a category cannot be found for a day, return an empty array for it.

3. MEAL ITEM IDENTIFICATION
- A meal item is any human-recognizable dish name.
- Ignore:
  - Nutritional data
  - Calories
  - Percentages
  - Explanatory footnotes
  - UI labels
- If a dish is marked as vegan or vegetarian in any way, append "(Vegan)" to the Turkish name.

4. TEXT CLEANING
- Strip all HTML tags and UI noise.
- Remove icons, emojis, bullets, numbering, and decorative symbols.
- Trim whitespace.
- If a dish is written across multiple lines, merge it into one name.
- If text contains alternatives like "X veya Y", split into multiple meal items.

5. LANGUAGE HANDLING
- If the dish name is in Turkish:
  - Use it as "tr"
  - Translate it naturally into English for "en"
- If the dish name is already in English:
  - Use it for both "tr" and "en"
- Keep translations literal and cafeteria-appropriate.

6. CONSISTENCY RULES
- Never invent meals.
- Never merge meals across days.
- Never drop required keys.
- Never output null — use empty arrays instead.

========================
FINAL RULE
========================

Output ONLY the final JSON array.
No commentary.
No markdown.
No apologies.
