        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">BilMenu</span> is a web/mobile app that was
          first published on <span class="highlight">October 30, 2017</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a foreign student at Bilkent University, I always found it hard to
          read the
          <a href="http://kafemud.bilkent.edu.tr/monu_eng.html"
            >University's Cafeteria menu</a
          >
          with both English and Turkish names. This menu shows a list of the
          daily meals of around 20 meal items. This is the standard in most
          universities, but I found it very annoying. Especially, after just
          coming out of a final exam for which you had to read 300 slides +
          textbooks, the last thing I wanted to do was to read a long list of
          foods, most of which I don't understand or I just couldn't even bother
          to create a visual image of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I came up with the idea of showing the meals visually using images
          *for my own sake*.
        </p>
        <p>
          One problem with fetching images from Google or other public sources
          is image copyrights and privacy policies. As the app was supposed to
          be for free, fetching public images didn't make sense. I needed a
          solution but lacked the budget, so spending money for it was not an
          option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, I decided to instead take a picture of meals every day and
          collect them for the app. The Cafeteria boasts a wide range of meals,
          however, they mostly repeat the same food, just on longer intervals.
          This meant that after collecting a number of images, the majority of
          meal plans would have a picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I had collected about <span class="highlight">100 images</span>,
          I started editing them out on Photoshop one by one to edit out the
          background, which is why you see only the plate there. This was done
          for personal UX reasons only.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, I had already done a first version of the
          <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bilmenu"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Android App</a
          >, and included the images on it too. After talking with some friends
          and because I was excited to know how such apps could be published
          live I decided to publish it to Google Play Store. I shared it with a
          couple of friends at the University and started to get some feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main problem of the app was that there weren't enough pictures so
          I continued to collect more. Some friends also helped from time to
          time. I maintained the app up until my graduation which was in
          <span class="highlight">2019</span>. The app managed to get about
          <span class="highlight">700 total downloads</span> and at its peak it
          had about <span class="highlight">100 Active users per week</span>. It
          was a nice experiment on live production and deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          After leaving the University, I did not have time to take care of it
          anymore and the project became stale. My coding abilities were not
          good enough at the point and there wasn't even a GitHub repo of it.
          The code lived only on my Laptop. As expected I lost the source code
          of the main app, and some of the pictures.
        </p>
        <p>
          During <span class="highlight">2020-2021</span>, the
          <a
            href="#"
            target="_blank"
            onclick="this.href=window.URL"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >website</a
          >
          from where I was parsing the info from decided to post a PDF of the
          meals as the Cafeteria was closed due to global circumstances.
          Instead, take-away meals were set as standard. This meant that the
          website parser I had written would be broken. With the source code
          being lost I had no way of fixing the issue. I had left some fallback
          mechanisms which were hosted on a free web hosting site, but that
          expired too.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, adjacent to the
          <span class="highlight">BilMenu</span> Android App, I had also created
          a simple website version of it. I managed to salvage some code and
          most importantly collected images (although some were lost) and I
          decided to re-write the whole thing as a website and make it a proper
          open-source project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current aim of this open-source project is to bring the app to a
          stable state, where the most minimal maintenance is required. This is
          why I have opted out of Angular, React, or the fancy web frameworks,
          since you would need to update the dependencies every once in a while.
          Since the app has nothing to do with sensitive data, having a database
          also doesn't make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, I decided to instead of using a hosting website with a paid
          subscription to host it on
          <span class="highlight">GitHub Pages</span>. This meant that I didn't
          have to pay for the Storage Hosting. One challenge though for the
          website is that you cannot parse the contents of another website
          within yours as that is not allowed due to
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >CORS policies</a
          >. That meant that for the parsing to work, a webserver was needed (=
          subscription charges). This is why I decided to instead do the parsing
          separately and store the JSON structure of it in the GitHub repo as
          well. This would then be deployed using GitHub Pages. The parsing is
          automatically done using a NodeJs script (which had to be re-written
          from its previous Java implementation) and it runs every Monday around
          8-10 AM which is the time when the Cafeteria Website is usually
          updated too.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a list of issues on the
          <span class="highlight">GitHub Repo</span> that need to be tackled
          before the project can be called as "Done".
        </p>
        <p>Some past and new challenges:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the parsing algorithm highly depends on the parsed website.
            Sometimes the parsed website maintainers randomly decide to change
            the structure, which leads to us having to change the parsing
            algorithm again.
          </li>
          <li>
            the currently parsed official Cafeteria website is a very old one
            too. It seems like the meal plans are saved in some sort of
            Microsoft Word format, which is then dropped into some CMS system
            (possibly Wordpress). This makes parsing the meals out of it a real
            challenge.
          </li>
          <li>
            With AI, the parsing was finally solved. In 2025 I started using
            Gemini API free credits, to request it to parse the meals and so far
            it has been working pretty well.
          </li>
          <li>
            The website domain name
            <span class="highlight">bilmenu.com</span> is currently the only
            cost of the project. It would be nice to have an option to somehow
            make it at least a zero-cost project to offset costs, be it through
            donations, or maybe cooperating with the university.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Android App needs to be re-written. The current goal is to just
            wire the Website into an Android App since rewriting the design in a
            native app would be too time-consuming. Luckily, for publishing this
            to Google Play Store there are no extra charges.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is not yet an Apple Store app, obviously because it costs
            around 100$ per year, but it would be very much needed as lots of
            students have iPhones and not only Androids. This could be done if I
            decide to make other iOS apps too, but it's currently far away in
            the RoadMap.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As an ex-Student of Bilkent University, it would be nice to have
          currently enrolled students contribute to the project's maintenance.
          It would be a good option of working on your coding skills and
          open-source projects.
